Package Maintainers:

The standard SystemImager build process doesn't depend of external sources anymore.


    Do a "make source_tarball".  This will create a single source tarball
    that you can use for your build process. This tarball is ready for packaging 
       
    e.g.: to build the rpm, do:
          rpmbuild -tb systemimager-<version>.tar.bz2
